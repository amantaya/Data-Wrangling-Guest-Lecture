# Background - The Scenario

You are a graduate student at the Great Plains State University (not a real college) in the Department of Animal Science. Under the guidance of your graduate research advisor, your are tasked with investigating the effects of forage type on milk yield.

There are two different forages provided to the dairy cows in your study:

- Corn Silage
- Roughage (hay)

Your advisor has asked you to present the results from these trials at the prestigious Intergalactic Animal Science Conference in just a week's time.

To further complicate matters, you have 2 undergraduate research technitians working under you, and they like to enter in data in different ways. This has caused quite the headache for you, as the data has become quite messy.

The undergraduate research technitians provide you with 2 files:

[feed_intake.csv](data/raw/feed_intake.csv)
[milk_yield.csv](data/raw/milk_yield.csv)

Your job is to:

1. figure out what is wrong with the data
2. fix inconsistent data and get it into the correct format
3. join the two data sets
4. use a t-test to compare the effect of forage type on milk yield
5. plot your results
